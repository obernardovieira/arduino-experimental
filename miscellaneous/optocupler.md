# Optocupler

> An opto-isolator \(also called an optocoupler, photocoupler, or optical isolator\) is an electronic component that transfers electrical signals between two isolated circuits by using light.\[1\] Opto-isolators prevent high voltages from affecting the system receiving the signal.\[2\] Commercially available opto-isolators withstand input-to-output voltages up to 10 kV\[3\] and voltage transients with speeds up to 25 kV/Î¼s.\[4\]
