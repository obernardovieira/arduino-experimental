# NRF24L01

There's no magic with this module.

It only needs to be connected the right way. Forget anything you have seen on the internet.

# Wiring

The module have 8 pins, form which one will not be used when connected to arduino.

So, first things first. There's a _VCC, GND, MOSI_ and _MISO_ pins. Connect to the respetive pins in the arduino, does not matter the module! The VCC should receive 3.3v and there's a current it's variable, see [https://www.itead.cc/wiki/NRF24L01\_Module](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/NRF24L01_Module "here")!

Only two are missing, the port _CE_ and _CSN_. Well, use any two free ports.

In arduino micro I used D9 and D10 respectively and in NodeMCU I used D2 and D4 respectively!

Depending on the arduino, you may have to use D like D9 or just the 9. In NodeMCU I used, in arduino micro, not.

The NRF package from tmrh20 is initialized using `RF24 (uint8_t _cepin, uint8_t _cspin)`.

# The example running

Any example from the package downloaded!

Sometimes there's problems associated to the package to be downloaded and added manually!

Install it using the arduino IDE.

**IMPORTANT NOTES** You can use the same example code from the package to both arduinos, only have to change the`bool radioNumber = 0;` which identifies the two radios!
