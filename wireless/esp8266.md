## What is does?

A simple arduino with wifi board connected, and in this case working as a station \(STA\), which simply connect to an wifi and runs a webserver on port 80 showing some data from inputs.

**To visit the webserver **you should know the ip. It's possible to make arduino show it's own ip, but also, it's possible to get the ip from`sudo arp-scan --interface=wlp3s0 --localnet`. But with that command all ip's in that network will be shown.

See the AT commands
