# Arduino Experimental

This is my gitbook for experiments I've been doing through time.

My first board was an arduino micro, which is still the one I use the most, apart from that I also have a nodemcu which I also use a lot. Most tests are done using one of those two.

Again this is only a set of tests I've been doing to use in other projects. Since I don't work with arduinos at my work and I also don't work very often with it, this is more a way to save reusable samples.
